I can spend hours developing full-stack applications. I love creating the logical processes in the backend and watch them populate a front end webpage. My go-to languages are JavaScript and Python.

When I'm not coding, I'm practicing, recording, or gigging with one of my four bands. I'm a guitar player who also sings and plays bass, drums, organ, and piano.
